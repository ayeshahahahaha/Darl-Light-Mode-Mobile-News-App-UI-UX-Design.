Improved Focus â€“ Dark backgrounds help text and media content stand out.

Energy Efficiency â€“ Particularly effective on OLED displays, dark mode uses less power.

Accessibility â€“ Supports users with light sensitivity or certain visual impairments by offering alternative contrast settings.

By meeting contrast ratio guidelines, this design ensures that all text elements remain easily legible in both light and dark modes.
